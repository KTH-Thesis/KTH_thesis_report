The present chapter illustrates the stabilization of a group of agents whose
motion dynamics are expressed by equations
\eqref{eq:unicycle_kinematic_with_disturbances}, and whose errors with respect
to their respective steady-state configurations are
constrained by a restricted (compared to the unadulterated $\mathcal{E}_{i}$)
constraint set, aiming at attenuating disturbances. The control laws are
designed as in chapter \ref{chapter:stabilization_with_disturbance}.

In this setting, we consider the stabilization of three agents. Agent 1
is constrained in maintaining connectivity with agents 2 and 3 (and
homologously vice-versa). All have to avoid colliding with each other
and the obstacles in the workspace, and reach their desired configurations
under the pressure of being disturbed. The number of obstacles is two. The gap
between them suffices for one agent to pass between them, but not for two or
more.
