\subsection{Notation}

The set of positive integers is denoted by$\mathbb{N}$. The real $n$-coordinate
space, with $n\in\mathbb{N}$, is denoted by $\mathbb{R}^n$;
$\mathbb{R}^n_{\geq 0}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n_{> 0}$ are the sets of real
$n$-vectors with all elements nonnegative and positive, respectively. Given a
set $S$, we denote as $\lvert S\lvert$ its cardinality. The notation
$\|\vect{x}\|$ is used for the Euclidean norm of a vector
$\vect{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Given a symmetric matrix
$\mat{A} = \mat{A}^T, \lambda_{\text{min}}(\mat{A}) = \min \{|\lambda| : \lambda \in \sigma(\mat{A}) \}$
denotes the minimum eigenvalue of $\mat{A}$, respectively, where
$\sigma(\mat{A})$ is the set of all the eigenvalues of
$\mat{A}$ and $\text{rank}(\mat{A})$ is its rank;
$\mat{A} \otimes \mat{B}$ denotes the Kronecker product of matrices
$\mat{A}, \mat{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$,
as was introduced in \cite{horn_jonshon}.
Define by
$\mathbbm{1}_n \in \mathbb{R}^n, I_n \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}, 0_{m \times n} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$
the column vector with all entries $1$, the unit matrix and the $m \times n$
matrix with all entries zeros, respectively.
A matrix $\mat{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is called skew-symmetric if and only
if $\mat{A}^\top = -\mat{A}$.
$\mathcal{B}(\vect{c},r) = \{\vect{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3: \|\vect{x}-\vect{c}\| \leq r\}$
is the $3$D sphere of radius $r \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and center
$\vect{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

The vector expressing the coordinates of the origin of frame $\{j\}$ in
frame $\{i\}$ is denoted by $\vect{p}_{j \triangleright i}$. When this vector is
expressed in 3D space in a third frame, frame $\{k\}$, it is denoted by
$\vect{p}_{j \triangleright i}^{k}$.
%Given $\vect{a}\in\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mat{S}(\vect{a})$ is the skew-symmetric
%matrix defined according to $\mat{S}(\vect{a})\vect{b} = \vect{a}\times \vect{b}$.
The angular velocity of frame $\{j\}$ with respect to frame $\{i\}$, expressed
in frame $\{k\}$ coordinates, is denoted by
$\vect{\omega}^k_{j \triangleright i}\in \mathbb{R}^{3}$.
We also use the notation $\mathbb{M} = \mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{T}^3$.
We further denote as $\vect{q}_{j \triangleright i} \in \mathbb{T}^3$
the Euler angles representing the orientation of frame $\{j\}$ with respect to
frame $\{i\}$, where $\mathbb{T}^3$ is the $3$D torus.
For notational brevity, when a coordinate frame corresponds to the inertial frame
of reference $\{\mathcal{O}\}$, we will omit its explicit notation
(e.g., $\vect{p}_i = \vect{p}_{i \triangleright \mathcal{O}} = \vect{p}^\mathcal{O}_{i \triangleright \mathcal{O}}$,
$\vect{\omega}_i = \vect{\omega}_{i \triangleright \mathcal{O}} = \vect{\omega}^\mathcal{O}_{i \triangleright \mathcal{O}}$).
All vector and matrix differentiations are derived with respect to the inertial
frame $\{\mathcal{O}\}$ unless stated otherwise .


\subsection{Graph Theory}
\note{?? ISTORISOU // EXPAND}
An \textit{undirected graph} $\mathcal{G}$ is a pair
$(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is a finite set of nodes,
representing a team of agents, and
$\mathcal{E} \subseteq \big\{ \{i,j\} : i,j \in \mathcal{V}, i \neq j \big\}$,
with $M = |\mathcal{E}|$, is the set of edges that model the communication
capability between neighboring agents. For each agent, its neighbors' set
$\mathcal{N}_i$ is defined as
$\mathcal{N}_i = \{i_1, \ldots, i_{N_i}\} = \big\{ j \in \mathcal{V} : \{i,j\} \in \mathcal{E}\big\}$,
where $i_1, \ldots, i_{N_i}$ is an enumeration of the neighbors of agent $i$
and $N_i = |\mathcal N_i|$.

If there is an edge $\{i, j\} \in \mathcal{E}$, then $i, j$ are called
\textit{adjacent}. A \textit{path} of length $r$ from vertex $i$ to vertex
$j$ is a sequence of $r+1$ distinct vertices, starting with $i$ and ending
with $j$, such that consecutive vertices are adjacent. For $i = j$, the path
is called a \text{cycle}. If there is a path between any two vertices of the
graph $\mathcal{G}$, then $\mathcal{G}$ is called \textit{connected}.
A connected graph is called a \text{tree} if it contains no cycles.
