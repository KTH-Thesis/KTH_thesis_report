In this section, a systematic solution to Problem \ref{problem} is introduced.
Our overall approach builds on formulating a model predictive control
optimization problem for each agent such that solution this captures all
the desired control specifications. The following analysis is performed:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The form of the proposed optimizaton problem is described in Section \ref{sec:distributed_mpc}.
	\item The feasibility of the problem is given in \ref{sec:feasibility_analysis}.
	\item The stability analysis is given in \ref{sec:stability_analysis}.
\end{enumerate}
