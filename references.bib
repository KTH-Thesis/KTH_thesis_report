abstract = "We consider the control of interacting subsystems whose dynamics and constraints are decoupled, but whose state vectors are coupled non-separably in a single cost function of a finite horizon optimal control problem. For a given cost structure, we generate distributed optimal control problems for each subsystem and establish that a distributed receding horizon control implementation is stabilizing to a neighborhood of the objective state. The implementation requires synchronous updates and the exchange of the most recent optimal control trajectory between coupled subsystems prior to each update. The key requirements for stability are that each subsystem not deviate too far from the previous open-loop state trajectory, and that the receding horizon updates happen sufficiently fast. The venue of multi-vehicle formation stabilization is used to demonstrate the distributed implementation. "

abstract="The decentralized navigation function methodology, established in our previous work for navigation of multiple holonomic agents with global sensing capabilities is extended to the case of local sensing capabilities. Each agent plans its actions without knowing the destinations of the others and the positions of those agents lying outside its sensing neighborhood. The stability properties of the closed loop system are checked via Lyapunov stability techniques for nonsmooth systems. The collision avoidance and global convergence properties are verified through simulations.",

abstract = "In this paper we derive a set of constraints that are sufficient to guarantee maintained connectivity in a leader–follower multi-agent network with a proximity based communication topology. In the scenario we consider, only the leaders are aware of the global mission, which is to converge at a known destination point. Thus, the followers need to stay in contact with the group of leaders in order to reach the goal. In the paper we show that we can maintain the initial network structure, and thereby connectivity, by setting up bounds on the ratio of leaders-to-followers and on the magnitude of the goal attraction force experienced by the leaders. The results are first established for an initially complete communication graph and then extended to an incomplete graph. The results are illustrated by computer simulations. "

abstract = "Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue. "
