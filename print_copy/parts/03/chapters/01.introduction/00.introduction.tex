The present part illustrates the efficacy of the advocated solutions, as
described in chapters \ref{chapter:stabilization_without_disturbance} and
\ref{chapter:stabilization_with_disturbance}, with regard to stabilization
of multiple inter-constrained agents, under the absence or presence
of additive disturbances, in chapters
\ref{chapter:simulations_without_disturbances} and
\ref{chapter:simulations_with_disturbances} respectively.

The benefit of solving the problem this thesis addresses, as was formulated in
chapter \ref{chapter:prob_formulation} and approached in chapters
\ref{chapter:stabilization_without_disturbance} and
\ref{chapter:stabilization_with_disturbance}, is that the procured solutions can
be applied to a general class of likewise problems $-$ the similarity relation
relates to/the terms, the dynamic nature of the actors, and the structure of
their habitat, but not the spirit of the problem itself.

All simulations were performed with the MATLAB NMPC routine provided with
\cite{grune2016nonlinear}. The source code of the simulations can be found on
github\footnote{\githuburl}.\\[2.5ex]
