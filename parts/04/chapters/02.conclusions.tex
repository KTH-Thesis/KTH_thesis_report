\chapter{Conclusions}

This thesis addressed the problem of stabilizing a non-point multi-agent system
under constraints relating to the maintenance of connectivity between
agents, the aversion of collision among agents and between agents and
stationary obstacles within their working environment, and constraints
regarding their states and control inputs. In this thesis, two non-linear
model-predictive control schemes are designed, with the aim of stabilizing
all agents of the multi-agent system to predetermined desired configurations
while satisfying all pertinent constraints at all times. The first scheme
considers that the model of the system is perfectly known and that disturbances
affecting its states are absent; the second considers the presence of
bounded additive uncertainties.

After formulating and positing the motivating problem of this work
(chapter \ref{chapter:prob_formulation}), the control regimes and sufficient or
necessary conditions were documented (the conditions are mild in reality),
leading to the proofs that the compound multi-agent system can be stabilized
asymptotically in the disturbance-free case
(chapter \ref{chapter:stabilization_without_disturbance}), and in the case where
uncertainty is present (chapter \ref{chapter:stabilization_with_disturbance}),
that the trajectory of each agent can be made to get trapped in a neighbourhood
of its desired set point $-$ a neighbourhood smaller than if disturbances
were left unattenuated.

The efficacy of the two designed control regimes is verified through computer
simulations (chapters \ref{chapter:simulations_without_disturbances} and
\ref{chapter:simulations_with_disturbances}) on the equivalent problem to the
posed $12-D$ one, the problem of a multi-unicycle system having to avoid
collisions altogether, while agents are obliged to keep between certain distance
bounds between them, and the obstacles littered in their environment, $-$ and
state and input constraints. This is the conclusion of this work.
