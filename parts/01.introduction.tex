\noindent In many control problems it is desired to design a stabilizing
feedback such that a performance criterion is minimized while satisfying
constraints on the controls and the states. Ideally one would look for a
closed solution for the feedback law satisfying the constraints while
optimizing the performance. However, typically the optimal feedback law
cannot be found analytically, even in the unconstrained case, since it involves
the solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential
equations. One approach to circumvent this problem is the repeated solution of
an open-loop optimal control problem for a given state. The first part of the
resulting open-loop input signal is implemented and the whole process is
repeated. Control approaches using this strategy are referred to as Model
Predictive Control (MPC).
