\subsection{Problem Statement}

In this section, the problem considered will be stated in a concrete manner.\\

Due to the fact that the agents are not dimensionless and their communication
capabilities are limited, the control protocol should for all
agents $i \in \mathcal{V}$ guarantee that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the desired positions $\vect{p}_{i,des}$ are achieved in finite time
  \item the desired angles $\vect{q}_{i,des}$ are achieved in finite time
  \item connectivity between neighbouring agents $j \in \mathcal{N}_i$ is
    maintained at all times
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, for all agents $i \in \mathcal{V}$, obstacles $\ell \in \mathcal{L}$
and the workspace boundary $W$, it should guarantee for all
$t\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item all agents avoid collision with each other
  \item all agents avoid collision with all obstacles
  \item all agents avoid collision with the workspace boundary
  \item singularity of the Jacobian matrices $\mat{J}_i$ is avoided
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, all neighboring agents of agent $i$ must remain within a distance
less than $d_i$ from him, for all $i \in \mathcal{V}: |\mathcal{N}_i| \not= 0$,
and all agents $i, j\in \mathcal{V}, i \neq j$ must remain within distance
greater than $\underline{d}_{ij,a}$ with one another.\\

Formally, the control problem under the aforementioned constraints is
formulated as follows:

\begin{bg_box}
\begin{problem}
  Consider $N$ agents modeled as bounded spheres $\mathcal{B}(\vect{p}_i, r_i)$,
  $i \in \mathcal{V}, N = |\mathcal{V}|$, that operate in workspace $W$ that is
  also modeled as a bounded sphere $\mathcal{B}(\vect{p}_W,r_W)$,
  featuring $|\mathcal{L}|$ spherical obstacles, also modeled as bounded
  spheres $\mathcal{B}(\vect{p}_{\ell}, r_{\ell}), \ell \in \mathcal{L}$.

  Each agent $i$ is governed by the dynamics \eqref{eq:system}, and the compound
  system of agents, obstacles and the workspace is subject to assumptions
  \eqref{ass:measurements_access}, \eqref{ass:initial_conditions},
  \eqref{ass:intra_environmental_arrangement}. Given desired \textit{feasible}
  steady-state agent configurations $\vect{x}_{i,des}$, $\vect{v}_{i,des}$,
  $\forall i \in \mathcal{V}$, design decentralized control laws
  $\vect{u}_i \in \mathcal{U}_i \subset \mathbb{R}^6$ such that
  $\forall i \in \mathcal{V}$ and for all times $t \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$,
  the following hold:

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Position and orientation configuration is achieved in steady-state
      $$\lim_{t \to \infty} \|\vect{x}_i(t) - \vect{x}_{i,des}(t)\| = 0$$
      $$\lim_{t \to \infty} \|\vect{v}_i(t) - \vect{v}_{i,des}(t)\| = 0$$

    \item Inter-agent collision is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_i(t) - \vect{p}_j(t)\| > \underline{d}_{ij,a},
      \forall j \in \mathcal{V} \backslash \{i\}$$

    \item Agent-with-obstacle collision is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_i(t) - \vect{p}_{\ell}(t)\| > \underline{d}_{i\ell,o},
      \forall \ell \in \mathcal{L}$$

    \item Agent-with-workspace-boundary collision is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_W - \vect{p}_i(t)\| < r_W - r_i$$

    \item Inter-agent connectivity loss between neighbouring agents is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_i(t) - \vect{p}_j(t)\| < d_i,
      \forall j \in \mathcal{N}_i$$

    \item All maps $\mat{J}_i$ are well defined
      $$- \frac{\pi}{2} < \theta_i(t) < \frac{\pi}{2}$$

  \end{enumerate}
