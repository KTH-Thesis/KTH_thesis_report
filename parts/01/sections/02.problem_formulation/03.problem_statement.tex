\subsection{Problem Statement}
Due to the fact that the agents are not dimensionless and their communication
capabilities are limited, the control protocol should for all neighboring
agents $i \in \mathcal{V}, j \in \mathcal{N}_i$ make sure that:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item the desired position formation $\vect{p}_{ij, \text{des}}$ is achieved
    in finite time
  \item the desired formation angles $\vect{q}_{ij, \text{des}}$ are achieved
    in finite time
  \item connectivity between initially connected agents (neighbours) is
    maintained at all times, i.e. all edges of $\mathcal{G}(t=0)$ are maintained
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, for all agents $i \in \mathcal{V}$, obstacles $\ell \in \mathcal{L}$
and the workspace boundary $W$, it should guarantee for all
$t\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ that:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item all agents avoid collision with each other
  \item all agents avoid collision with all obstacles
  \item all agents avoid collision with the workspace boundary
  \item singularity of the Jacobian matrices $\mat{J}_i$ is avoided
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, all neighboring agents of agent $i$ must remain within a distance
less than $d_i$ from him, for all $i \in \mathcal{V}$,
and all agents $i, j\in \mathcal{V}, i \neq j$ must remain within distance
greater than $\underline{d}_{ij,a}$ with one another.

Formally, the control problem under the aforementioned constraints is
formulated as follows:

\begin{bg_box}
\begin{problem}
  Consider $N$ agents modeled as bounded spheres $\mathcal{B}(\vect{p}_i, r_i)$,
  $i \in \mathcal{V}, |V| = N$ that operate in workspace $W$ that is also modeled
  as a bounded sphere $\mathcal{B}(\vect{p}_W,r_W)$, featuring $|\mathcal{L}|$ spherical obstacles,
  also modeled as bounded spheres $\mathcal{B}(p_{\ell}, r_{\ell}), \ell \in \mathcal{L}$.
  Each agent $i$ is governed by the dynamics \eqref{eq:system}, under assumptions
  \ref{ass:measurements_access}, \ref{ass:initial_conditions},
  \ref{ass:after_formation_geometry}. Given desired \textit{feasible}
  inter-agent displacements $\vect{p}_{ij,des}$, $\vect{q}_{ij,des}$,
  $\forall i \in \mathcal{V}, j \in \mathcal{N}_i$ such that

  $$\underline{d}_{ij,a} < d_{ij,a} < d_i, \forall (i,j) \in
  \{(i,j) \in \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V}:
  \|\vect{p}_i - \vect{p}_j - \vect{p}_{ij,des}\| = 0\}$$

  design decentralized control laws $\vect{u}_i \in \mathbb{R}^6$ such that
  $\forall i \in \mathcal{V}$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ the following
  hold:

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Position and orientation formation is achieved in steady-state
      $$\lim_{t \to \infty} \|\vect{x}_i(t) - \vect{x}_j(t) - \vect{x}_{ij,des}(t)\| < \mu_i,
        \forall j \in \mathcal{N}_i$$

    \item Inter-agent collision is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_i(t) - \vect{p}_j(t)\| > \underline{d}_{ij,a},
      \forall j \in \mathcal{V} \backslash \{i\}$$

    \item Agent-with-obstacle collision is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_i(t) - \vect{p}_{\ell}(t)\| > \underline{d}_{i\ell,o},
      \forall \ell \in \mathcal{L}$$

    \item Agent-with-workspace-boundary collision is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_i(t)\| + r_i < r_W$$

    \item Inter-agent connectivity loss is avoided
      $$\|\vect{p}_i(t) - \vect{p}_j(t)\| < d_i,
      \forall j \in \mathcal{N}_i$$

    \item All maps $\mat{J}_i$ are well defined
      $$\theta_i(t) \ne \pm \frac{\pi}{2}$$

  \end{enumerate}
\label{problem}
\end{problem}
\end{bg_box}
