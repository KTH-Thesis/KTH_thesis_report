\section{The operational model}

The simulacrum used for all agents in the following chapters shall be the
three-dimensional model of the unicycle; its motion shall be expressed by the
nonlinear continuous-time kinematic equations

\begin{align}
\label{eq:unicycle_kinematic}
  \dot{x}       &= v \cos\theta \\
  \dot{y}       &= v \sin\theta \\
  \dot{\theta}  &= \omega
\end{align}

with $\vect{z} = [x,y,\theta]^{\top}$ the vector of states,
$\vect{u} = [v, \omega]^{\top}$ the vector of inputs, and $\vect{\dot{z}} =
f(\vect{z}, \vect{u})$ the (model) system's equation. In this 2D environment,
the obstacles of the workspace along with the workspace boundary itself
assume an appropriately reformed form: that of a circle. The labeled space in
which an arbitrary agent $i$ moves, along with the
spherical-obstacles-transformed to circles, is depicted in figure
\eqref{fig:unicycle_figure}.
