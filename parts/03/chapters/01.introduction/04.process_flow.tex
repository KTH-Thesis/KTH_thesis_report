\section{Process \& information flow}

The designed procedure flow can be either concurrent or sequential, meaning
that agents can solve their individual FHOCP's and apply the control inputs
either at the same time as everyone else, or one by one. The conceptual
design itself is procedure-flow agnostic, and hence it can accommodate both
without loss of feasibility or successful stabilization. For lack of a stable
and usable multi-threaded \texttt{MATLAB} framework, the simulations where
carried out under the latter approach: each agent solves its own FHOCP and
applies the corresponding admissible control input in a round robin way,
considering the current and planned (open-loop state predictions) configurations
of all agents within its sensing range. Figures \eqref{fig:process_flow}
and \eqref{fig:information_flow} depict the sequential procedural and
informational regimes.

    figure implies recursive feasibility if the initial configuration is
    itself feasible.}

    agents within its sensing range $\mathcal{R}_i$ at arbitrary FHOCP
    solution time $t_k$. Agents $m,n \in \mathcal{R}_i(t_k)$ have solved their
    FHOCP; agent $i$ is next; agents $p,q \in \mathcal{R}_i(t_k)$ have not
    solved their FHOCP yet.}
