\section{Simulation scenarios}

The simulations were carried out under four different agents-obstacles
configurations:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Two agents avoid one obstacle on their way to their
    steady-state configurations, without colliding with each other and without
    being separated by the obstacle (we demand that their distance is always
    smaller than the obstacle's diameter for the aim of cooperation).
  \item Two agents pass through the space between two obstacles
    on their way to their steady-state configurations $-$ again, the maximum
    allowed distance between the two agents is smaller than the diameter
    of the obstacle with the smallest radius.
  \item Three agents avoid one obstacle on their way to their
    steady-state configurations, without colliding with each other and without
    being separated by the obstacle. In this case, two agents are
    (independently) neighbours of the third, that is, the third agent should
    maintain connectivity and avoid collision with both of the other two,
    but the latter will only have to avoid colliding with each other.
  \item Three agents pass through the space between two obstacles
    on their way to their steady-state configurations. The conditions of this
    scenario assume those of points 2 and 3.
\end{enumerate}

The four configurations are depicted in figures \eqref{fig:test_case_2_1},
\eqref{fig:test_case_2_2}, \eqref{fig:test_case_3_1} and
\eqref{fig:test_case_3_2}. Agent 1 is depicted in blue, agent 2 in
red and agent 3 in yellow. The obstacles are depicted in black. A faint line
connects neighbouring agents; it is coloured in green. Mark X
denotes the desired position of an agent and its colour signifies the agent
to be stabilized in that position.

All configurations are as follows: the radius of all agents
$i,j \in \mathcal{V}$ is $r_i = 0.5$; the radius of all obstacles is
$r_{\ell} = 1.0$; the sensing range of all agents has a radius of
$d_i = 4r_i + \epsilon = 2.0 + \epsilon$; the minimum distance between agents
is $\underline{d}_{ij,a} = 2r_i + \epsilon = 1.0 + \epsilon$, and the minimum
distance between agents and obstacles is
$\underline{d}_{i\ell,o} = r_i + r_{\ell} + \epsilon = 1.5 + \epsilon$.
$\epsilon$ was set to $\epsilon = 0.1$ in the disturbance-free cases and
$\epsilon = 0.01$ in the cases where disturbances are present.

In the case of two agents, $\mathcal{V} = \{1,2\}$,
the neighbouring sets are $\mathcal{N}_1 = \{2\}$
and $\mathcal{N}_2 = \{1\}$, while in the case of three agents,
$\mathcal{V} = \{1,2,3\}$, $\mathcal{N}_1 = \{2,3\}$,
$\mathcal{N}_2 = \{1\}$ and $\mathcal{N}_3 = \{1\}$.

Under the above configuration regime, all agents are constrained in bypassing
the obstacle(s) from the same side, as they are prohibited from overtaking it
(them) from different sides by the requirement that their sensing range be
lower than the sum of the diameter of one obstacle and the radii of any two
agents.\\[2.5ex]

All simulations exhibit the translation of the visited theory into practice:
in all test scenarios, all agents are successfully stabilized at, or about
their desired configurations without their constraints being violated.
Therefore, the next two chapters, instead of featuring all simulation results,
will feature an anthology of the results pertaining to the most challenging task
of those among the considered ones $-$ that of three agents having to negotiate
bypassing two obstacles while maintaining appropriate connectivity and avoiding
collisions. A comprehensive collection of all simulation results is featured in
appendices \ref{chapter:simulation_figures_without_disturbances} and
\ref{chapter:simulation_figures_with_disturbances}. The individual initial
and terminal configurations of each agent, the positions of the obstacles and
various other parameters are reported in the appropriate sections.
