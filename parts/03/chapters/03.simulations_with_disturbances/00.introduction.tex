The present chapter illustrates the stabilization of a group of agents whose
motion dynamics are expressed by equations
\eqref{eq:unicycle_kinematic_with_disturbances}, and whose errors with respect
to their respective steady-state configurations are
constrained by a restricted (compared to the unadulterated $\mathcal{E}_{i}$)
constraint set, aiming at attenuating disturbances. The control laws are
designed as in chapter \ref{chapter:stabilization_with_disturbance}.
