For compatibility with real situations, we assume that in the case
of disturbances, the signals affecting the agents are of the same nature
(consider for instance the case of UAV's affected by wind); the disturbance
signal considered was $\delta(t) = 0.1 * \sin 2t$. Therefore,
$\overline{\delta} = 0.1$
