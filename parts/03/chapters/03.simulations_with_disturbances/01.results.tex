\section{Simulation results}

In this case the initial configurations of the three agents are
$\vect{z}_1$ $=$ $[-6, 3.5, 0]^{\top}$,
$\vect{z}_2$ $=$ $[-6, 2.3, 0]^{\top}$ and
$\vect{z}_3$ $=$ $[-6, 4.7, 0]^{\top}$.
Their desired configurations in steady-state are
$\vect{z}_{1,des}$ $=$ $[6, 3.5, 0]^{\top}$,
$\vect{z}_{2,des}$ $=$ $[6, 2.3, 0]^{\top}$ and
$\vect{z}_{3,des}$ $=$ $[6, 4.7, 0]^{\top}$.
Obstacles $o_1$ and $o_2$ are placed between the two at $[0, 2.0]^{\top}$
and $[0, 5.5]^{\top}$ respectively. The penalty
matrices $\mat{Q}$, $\mat{R}$, $\mat{P}$ were set to
$\mat{Q} = 0.7 (I_3 + 0.5\dagger_3)$, $\mat{R} = 0.005 I_2$ and
$\mat{P} = 0.5 (I_3 + 0.5\dagger_3)$, where $\dagger_N$ is a $N \times N$
matrix whose elements are chosen at random between the values $0.0$ and $1.0$.
The sampling time is $h = 0.1$ sec, the time-horizon is $T_p = 0.5$ sec, and
the total execution time given was $10$ sec.

For compatibility with real situations, we assume that the disturbance signals
affecting the agents are of the same nature (consider for instance the case
of UAV's affected by wind); the disturbance signal considered was
$\delta_i(t) = 0.1 * \sin 2t$ for all $i \in \mathcal{V} = \{1,2,3\}$.
Therefore, $\overline{\delta}_i = 0.1$.

The evolution of the trajectories of the agents in the
$x-y$ plane is omitted; they are (with minor variations) equivalent to those
in the case where disturbances are absent. Figures
\eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_distance_agents_13} and
\eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_distance_obstacle_1_agents} show the evolution of the
distance between agents 1 and 3 through time, and the evolution of the
distance between all agents and obstacle $o_1$ respectively.
Figure \eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_inputs_agent_2} shows the input signals
directing agent 2 through time. Just as in the case of absent disturbances,
the compound system manages to clear the narrow between the two obstacles without
agents colliding with each other or the obstacles, and in general, without
violating any constraint present.

Figure \eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_errors_agent_1} depicts the evolution of the
error states of agent 1 through time. In contrast to the disturbance-free
case, the error states do not converge to 0 at steady-state; rather, they
oscillate periodically in accordance with the periodic nature of the disturbance,
and in this case, with different amplitudes. Component-wise,
the $y-$component exhibits the largest amplitude (the compound system oscillates
in the vertical direction), however the largest effect of the disturbance
is still being attenuated by a factor of 2: the peak-to-peak values of the
$y-$component are approximately 0.1, which is half of the peak-to-peak value
of the disturbance signal. For the $x-$ and $\theta-$components, the
disturbance is attenuated by a factor of approximately 4.
Boundary values for the inputs and distances are portrayed in the colour

Last but not at all least, figures
\eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_V}, \eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_V_zoom} and
\eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_V_zoom_zoom} depict
the evolution of the quadratic Lyapunov function
$\vect{e}^{\top} \mat{P} \vect{e}$ through time for all three agents.
The related constants concerned with the execution
of this simulation are as follows: $L_{g_i} = 10.7354$, $L_{V_i} = 0.0471$,
$\varepsilon_{\Psi_i} = 0.0654$ and $\varepsilon_{\Omega_i} = 0.0035$ for
all $i \in \mathcal{V}$. The zoom-in'ed version of figure
\eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_V}, figure \eqref{fig:d_ON_res_3_2_V_zoom},
illustrates that once the energy measure of each agent (as measured by
the Lyapunov function $V = \vect{e}^{\top} \mat{P} \vect{e}$) becomes lower than
$\varepsilon_{\Psi}$ (alternatively $-$ when each system's trajectory enters
set $\Psi$), it gets trapped below the value $\varepsilon_{\Omega}$ (and
hence each system's trajectory is in turn trapped inside the terminal
set $\Omega$) in finite time, and does not exit it.

Due to the interconstrained nature of the compound system, it is advisable that
once the trajectories of \textit{all} agents reach set $\Psi$ $-$ in other
words, once they all reach the vicinity of their desired configurations as
measured by $\varepsilon_{\Psi}$ $-$ it is advisable that they disable their
interconnectedness: since they have all reached the intended feasible
desired configurations it is already guaranteed that they will not collide with
each other or violate the connectivity constraints. If their interconnectedness
is not disabled, then the disturbance affecting each agent could propagate
from one agent to the rest due the fact that the trajectory of each agent
is regulated indirectly by the predicted states of its neighbours.
