The present chapter illustrates the stabilization of a group of agents whose
motion dynamics are expressed by equations \eqref{eq:unicycle_kinematic}, and
whose errors with respect to their respective steady-state configurations are
constrained by the set found in equation \eqref{eq:error_constraint_set_unicycle}.

Each of the following sections describes the initial and terminal configurations,
and the penalty matrices $\mat{Q}$, $\mat{R}$ and $\mat{P}$ used in each setting.
Furthermore, the errors of each agent with respect to its terminal configuration
are portrayed, along with its inputs signals and the distances between all
agents and obstacles. Boundary values for the aforementioned inputs and
distances shall be portrayed in the colour \textcolor{cyan}{cyan}.
All simulations were performed with a sampling time of $h = 0.1$ sec,
a time-horizon of $T_p = 0.5$ sec; the total execution time given was $3$ sec.
