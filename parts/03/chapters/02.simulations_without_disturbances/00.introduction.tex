The present chapter illustrates the stabilization of a group of agents whose
motion dynamics are expressed by equations \eqref{eq:unicycle_kinematic}, and
whose errors with respect to their respective steady-state configurations are
constrained by the set found in equation \eqref{eq:error_constraint_set_unicycle}.
The control laws are designed as in chapter
\ref{chapter:stabilization_without_disturbance}.
