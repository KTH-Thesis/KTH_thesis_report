The present chapter illustrates the stabilization of a group of agents whose
motion dynamics are expressed by equations \eqref{eq:unicycle_kinematic}, and
whose errors with respect to their respective steady-state configurations are
constrained by the set found in equation \eqref{eq:error_constraint_set_unicycle}.
The control laws are designed as in chapter
\ref{chapter:stabilization_without_disturbance}.

In this setting, we consider the stabilization of three agents. Agent 1
is constrained in maintaining connectivity with agents 2 and 3 (and
homologously vice-versa). All have to avoid colliding with each other
and the with the obstacles in the workspace, and reach their desired
configurations. The number of obstacles is two. The gap between them
suffices for one agent to pass between them, but not for two or more.
